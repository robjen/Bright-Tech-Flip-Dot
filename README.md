# Bright-Tech Flip Dot
Reverse engineer of old Bright-Tech flip dot display protocol

purchased a pair of these off ebay and have been working out the RS485 protocol by trial and error

will document this on a wiki here
may go on to write a simple driver for Arduino

big starting point to decoding was:
https://mattscode.com/category/flip-dot/

see first couple of pages where Matt is looking at the messages sent

I've gone further working out more of the message format

have also won a controller on ebay so with a bit of luck that will give me more original messages and help me decode it further
